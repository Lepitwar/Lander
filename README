To compile:
Assignment 3 code. Reads in the users inpute of gravity, thrusters and landscape file. 
ei)
./lander -t -20 -g 20 -f landscape.txt

Code from the ball.c and timer.c were referenced/used to implement timers and ncurses
in the final code.

Improvements:
The variables thrust, gravity, filename and 'i' can be used in any order
ie) 
./lander -t -20 -g 20 -f landscape.txt
./lander -g 20 -t -20 -f landscape.txt
./lander -f landscape.txt -g 20 -t -20 
 
Added A fuel bar:
You have 100 fuel cells, using the thrusters decrease the fuel cells
Fuel gauge shown in top left hand corner

Option to have a initial wind speed:
Prompts user to input an int to cause a drift to occur.
